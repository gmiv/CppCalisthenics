- **Chapter 5:** Concurrent and Network Programming
  - Multithreading and Concurrency, Network Programming Basics (currently disabled)
- **Chapter 6:** Design Patterns and Best Practices
  - Common Design Patterns, Code Optimization Techniques
- **Chapter 7:** Modern C++ Features and Practices
  - Modern C++ Features, Using Modern Libraries and Frameworks (currently disabled)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler supporting C++17 or higher (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- CMake 3.10 or higher for building the project
- (Optional) Boost libraries installed if you wish to enable Chapter 7's second half

### Building the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following commands to build the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build . --target all
   ```

### Running the Project
After building the project, you can run the executable from the `build` directory:
```bash
./CppCalisthenics
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to select and run examples from each chapter.
